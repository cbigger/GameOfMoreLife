# GameOfMoreLife
Starting with a python implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life, GOMF introduces player-configured NN-based organisms.

Currently we have gof.py, which is taken from a reddit post that I can't for the life of me find right now, and has few edits on top of it.
The controls are:

Clear Grid == `right`\n
Randomize Grid == `left`\n
Run Continuously == `up`\n
Pause Game == `down`\n
Single Frame Update == `s`\n

When paused, you can manually fill/empty cells with a left or right mouseclick.
