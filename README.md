# GameOfMoreLife
Starting with a python implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life, GOMF introduces player-configured NN-based organisms.

Currently we have gof.py, which is taken from a reddit post that I can't for the life of me find right now, and has few edits on top of it.
The controls are:

Clear Grid == `right`

Randomize Grid == `left`

Run Continuously == `up`

Pause Game == `down`

Single Frame Update == `s`

When paused, you can manually fill/empty cells with a left or right mouseclick.
